### 🔹 UC10 – Generic Quantity Class with Unit Interface for Multi-Category Support  
**Branch:**  `feature/UC10-GenericQuantity`

### 🎯 Objective
- Create a fully generic Quantity system  
- Support multiple measurement categories  
- Apply interface-based design  

### ✅ Implementation
- Introduced `IMeasurable` interface  
- Implemented category-specific enums (LengthUnit, WeightUnit)  
- Created Generic `Quantity<T extends IMeasurable>` class  
- Ensured:
  - Type-safe unit handling  
  - Category-safe operations  
  - Scalable architecture
